# odin-landingpage

A page for my dog made after a design from the odin project. I tried to structure this site whitout looking for
much help to understand how to use flexbox. The goal with this exercise was to understand flexbox and how to use them to structure diffrent elements.
I have not worked with responsiveness in this exercise.
